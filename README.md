# Hangman

## About

This classic word game has the player guess the letters to a secret word. 
For each incorrect letter, another part of the hangman is drawn. Try to 
guess the complete word before the hangman completes. The secret words in 
this version are all animals like RABBIT and PIGEON, but you can replace 
these with your own set of words.
